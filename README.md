# Virginia-Datathon-2025
Data-driven analysis to identify and prioritize Virginia’s most dangerous roads using crash, transit, and infrastructure data with geospatial clustering, predictive scoring, and interactive Folium maps.
#  Datathon 2025 – Data-Driven Road Safety Strategy for Virginia

**Team Name:** Neural Nexus  
**Role:** Data Analyst – Shreya Mishra  
**Project Type:** Geospatial Analysis, Predictive Modeling, Visualization  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, GeoPandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Folium

##  Objective

To identify and target the most dangerous 8% of Virginia's roads using a combination of crash severity, infrastructure investment, and transit accessibility. The aim was to generate actionable insights for improving public safety and optimizing state transportation investments.

---

## Problem Statement

> *"How can we leverage data to reduce traffic fatalities and improve transit access in Virginia’s underserved and high-risk regions?"*

---

## Key Tasks & Methodology

###  1. Data Integration & Cleaning
- Merged crash reports, infrastructure investments, and GTFS transit datasets.
- Cleaned and standardized records across multiple years and formats.

### 2. Geospatial Analysis
- Mapped crash clusters using **Folium** and **GeoPandas**.
- Created heatmaps to detect underserved but high-risk zones.

###  3. Trend Analysis
- Analyzed year-over-year fatality shifts by vehicle type (1994–2022).
- Visualized fatality patterns using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.

### 4. Predictive Risk Modeling
- Built a composite risk score using crash frequency, access mismatch, and funding data.
- Used scoring to prioritize high-impact zones for potential interventions.

##  Key Outputs

- Interactive Folium map showing crash clusters and risk zones
- Line and bar plots of fatality trends by vehicle type
- Prioritized intervention zones based on custom risk scoring model
- Final PDF presentation summarizing insights and recommendations
